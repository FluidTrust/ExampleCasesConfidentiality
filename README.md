# ExampleCasesConfidentiality

Contains a collection of all test models ([`testModels`](testModels) directory) & example models ([`exampleModels`](exampleModels) directory).

Only open one model as project in eclipse at a time.
Otherwise you might encounter issues as multiple dictionary & confidentiality query files exist with the same name.
